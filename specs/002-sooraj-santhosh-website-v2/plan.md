## Summary

This project is to build a static portfolio website for the singer Sooraj Santhosh, replacing the existing website at `www.soorajsanthosh.com`. The new website will replicate the content and functionality of the old site, with some specific changes, including a WhatsApp chat bubble, a contact form that opens the user's email client, and a dark mode feature. The website will be built with Next.js, using pnpm as the package manager and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **SEO-First Content:** The plan includes using Next.js for static site generation, which is great for SEO. All content will be structured with SEO in mind.
- **A11y (Accessibility) Compliance:** The plan includes using Tailwind CSS, which has accessibility features. We will also perform accessibility audits.
- **Minimal Design:** The design will be kept clean and simple, focusing on the content.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The navigation will be simple and intuitive.
- **Performant by Default:** The website will be a static site, which is inherently performant. We will also optimize images and other assets.
