# Research: Sooraj Santhosh Portfolio Website v2

## Decisions

### Next.js for Static Site

**Decision**: Use Next.js for building the static portfolio website.

**Rationale**: Next.js is a popular and powerful React framework that can be used to build static websites. It offers a great developer experience, and its static site generation (SSG) feature is perfect for this project, ensuring a performant website. While Next.js is often used for dynamic sites, its SSG capabilities are top-notch and will allow us to meet the project's performance goals.

**Alternatives considered**: Other static site generators like Gatsby or Hugo were considered, but Next.js was chosen due to its flexibility and the team's familiarity with the React ecosystem.
