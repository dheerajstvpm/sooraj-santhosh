# sooraj-santhosh Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. SEO-First Content
All content must be created with SEO best practices in mind, including keyword research, meta tags, and structured data. The goal is to maximize organic search visibility.

### II. A11y (Accessibility) Compliance
All components and pages must adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Use semantic HTML, provide alternative text for images, and ensure keyboard navigability.

### III. Consistent User Experience
Maintain a consistent look and feel across the entire website. Use a design system or a style guide to ensure that UI components are reused and applied consistently.

### IV. Performant by Default
The website must be fast. Optimize images, leverage Next.js static site generation (SSG), and minimize bundle sizes. Aim for a high Lighthouse score for performance.

## Technology Stack

This is a static website built with Next.js. All new features and components must be compatible with this stack.

## Development Workflow

Use feature branches for all new work. All code changes must be reviewed and approved via pull requests.

## Governance

Amendments to this constitution require a pull request and approval from the project maintainers. All pull requests must verify compliance with the constitution.
