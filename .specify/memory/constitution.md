# sooraj-santhosh Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. SEO-First Content
All content must be created with SEO best practices in mind, including keyword research, meta tags, and structured data. The goal is to maximize organic search visibility.

### II. A11y (Accessibility) Compliance
All components and pages must adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Use semantic HTML, provide alternative text for images, and ensure keyboard navigability.

### III. Minimal Design
Embrace a minimalist aesthetic. Every element should have a purpose. Avoid unnecessary decorations and visual clutter.

### IV. User-Friendly Interface
The interface should be intuitive and easy to use. Reduce cognitive load on the user. Prioritize clarity and simplicity.

### V. Performant by Default
The website must be fast. Optimize images, and minimize bundle sizes. Aim for a high Lighthouse score for performance.

## Development Workflow

Use feature branches for all new work. All code changes must be reviewed and approved via pull requests.

## Governance

Amendments to this constitution require a pull request and approval from the project maintainers. All pull requests must verify compliance with the constitution.
